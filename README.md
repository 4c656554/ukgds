# UKGDS

The United Kingdom Generic Distribution System (UKGDS) is a collection of
power system network models that are representative of UK distribution
networks.

## Unofficial

The UKGDS was developed by the
[Centre for Sustainable Electricity and Distributed Generation][SEDG] (SEDG).
The [link](http://www.sedg.ac.uk/ukgds/) to the UKGDS resources is currently
(29/04/2015) broken. This repository will provide an unofficial home for the
network models until such a time as the resources are back online or a
[takedown request][takedown] from SEDG is received. May it prove useful in the
meantime.

## License

No license for the UKGDS resources has been issued by SEDG. This
[issue][license] is currently outstanding.
